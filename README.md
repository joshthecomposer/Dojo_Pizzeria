# Dojo Pizzeria
This was an exercise I completed for Coding Dojo
### Objectives:
* Create a `function` called `pizzaOven` that returns a JavaScript (Pizza) Object
* Create a pizza with: `"deep dish", "traditional", ["mozzarella"], and ["pepperoni", "sausage"]`
* Create 2 more pizzas with any toppings we like!
* Bonus Challenge: Create a `function` called randomPizza that uses `Math.random()` to create a random pizza!
